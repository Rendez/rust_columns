# Rust Columns SEGA 1990 game for the terminal

`rust_columns` is a fun and easy to play game for the terminal, written in Rust. It is a work in progress game, that I use to learn several concepts of the Rust programming language, while doing so on a fun project.

### Run the game

You can run the game simply with:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

### Working terminals

Under the hood, all this library is using is the crate `crossterm`, therefore the same support applies:

- Windows Powershell
  - Windows 10 (Pro)
- Windows CMD
  - Windows 10 (Pro)
  - Windows 8.1 (N)
- Ubuntu Desktop Terminal
  - Ubuntu 17.10
- (Arch, Manjaro) KDE Konsole
- Linux Mint
